# Website Style Guide
> This webpage was created as a solution to a Codecademy exercise focussing on CSS layout and the box model. It is a hypothetical style guide for a non-existent website.

Improvements could definitely be made, but the current version of the page has served the purpose of starting to play with the box model.
